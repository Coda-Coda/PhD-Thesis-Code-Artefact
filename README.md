# Getting Started
## Codespaces + VSCoq (web)

*Note: Codespaces have free quotas but are not free in general, for more information see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).*

1. [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Coda-Coda/PhD-Thesis-Code-Artefact) Or [resume your existing Codespace](https://codespaces.new/Coda-Coda/PhD-Thesis-Code-Artefact?quickstart=1). It should take less than 5 minutes to create a new Codespace.
2. Open a `.v` file and use the keyboard shortcuts Alt+UpArrow and Alt+DownArrow to step forward and back through the proofs, and Alt+RightArrow to step forward up to the cursor. On macOS use Control+Option instead of Alt.
3. Delete the Codespace once you are finished, to avoid being charged for storage costs.

## Linux/macOS + CoqIDE via Nix (local)
1. Install Nix from https://nixos.org/download.
2. After cloning this repository, run `nix-shell` from inside the cloned folder. This should take less than 10 minutes the first time `nix-shell` is run and near-instant after that.
3. Run `make` from inside the cloned repository. On macOS, it may be necessary to first run `make` from inside the `DeepSEA` folder.
4. Run `coqide` and then open any of the `.v` files in CoqIDE to step through them interactively.

## Extra Steps to Rebuild Smart Contracts

The above steps only require Coq v8.14.1 but do not rebuild the smart contracts from the `.ds` source files.

To start a shell with a more complete set of dependencies (may take some time the first time it is run):

- Run `nix-shell contracts-full-shell.nix`.

To rebuild the smart contracts from source:

- Run `make contracts-full`.

To experiment with the `dsc` (the DeepSEA Compiler):

- Run `make dsc`.
- Run `dsc -h` to see usage. E.g. `dsc Crowdfunding.ds bytecode` (in the Chapter 5 folder).

## Windows/macOS/Linux Other Options (local)
1. Obtain Coq v8.14.1 and optionally CoqIDE from a package manager or through [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `make` from inside the cloned repository.
4. Run `coqide` and then open any of the `.v` files in CoqIDE to step through them interactively. Alternatively, install the [VSCoq Legacy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coq-community.vscoq1) Visual Studio Code extension and step through the proofs interactively in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

-------

Note: At some points during the proofs, the comments, e.g. `(* H1 *)`, contain the names of hypotheses of particular interest at that point in the proof.

## Section 4.1 "Coping with Reentrancy"

- [DeepSEA/core/Syntax.v (starting line 560)](https://github.com/Coda-Coda/PhD-Thesis-Code-Artefact/tree/main/DeepSEA/core/Syntax.v#L560) has the definition of the inductive proposition that defines the notion of a command following the *Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern*.

- [DeepSEA/Runtime.v (starting line 895)](https://github.com/Coda-Coda/PhD-Thesis-Code-Artefact/tree/main/DeepSEA/Runtime.v#L895) has the definitions of the tactics used to automatically prove that a command follows the *Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern*.

Obligations relating to calls to other functions within a smart contract (`CCcall`) are also facilitated by this `coqgen.ml` code.

- [Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/Crowdfunding/LayerCONTRACT.v (starting line 371)](https://github.com/Coda-Coda/PhD-Thesis-Code-Artefact/blob/main/Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/Crowdfunding/LayerCONTRACT.v#L371) has a concrete example of a generated proof obligation with its proof, relating to the `donate` function in the Crowdfunding smart contract following the *Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern*.

Please be aware of the licenses which apply to this repository. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

The DeepSEA compiler is partly based upon the CompCert verified compiler developed as a part of the INRIA CompCert research project. Please see https://compcert.org/ for more information about CompCert.

Please also note that the files in the subfolder [DeepSEA](./DeepSEA/) in particular are the combined work of all those involved in the development of DeepSEA. Those involved with the development of DeepSEA (targeting the EVM) include at least Vilhelm Sj√∂berg, Kinnari Dave, Daniel Britten, Maria A Schett, Xinyuan Sun, Qinshi Wang, Sean Noble Anderson, Steve Reeves, and Zhong Shao. These are the authors of the paper "*Foundational Verification of Smart Contracts through Verified Compilation*" available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08348. Please see this paper for a discussion of DeepSEA's verified compilation.

The remaining files, excluding those generated by `dsc`, are primarily my (Daniel Britten's) work.
The files generated by `dsc` are:
- The files in the folder: [Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/Crowdfunding](./Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/Crowdfunding/).
- The files in the folder: [Chapter-6-Case-Study-ERC-20-Wrapped-Ether-Token/ERC20WrappedEth](./Chapter-6-Case-Study-ERC-20-Wrapped-Ether-Token/ERC20WrappedEth/).
- The proof goals for the side-conditions proved in [Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/proofs/ObjCrowdfundingCodeProofs.v](./Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/proofs/ObjCrowdfundingCodeProofs.v). See [Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/Crowdfunding/ObjCrowdfundingCodeProofs.v](./Chapter-5-Case-Study-Crowdfunding/Crowdfunding/ObjCrowdfundingCodeProofs.v) for the original file generated by `dsc`.

The original file does not include some additional assumptions made, relating to very high amounts of wrapped ether being unattainable, as well as making the information from the lemma `total_supply_correct` from [Chapter-6-Case-Study-ERC-20-Wrapped-Ether-Token/proofs/ERC20WrappedEth.v](./Chapter-6-Case-Study-ERC-20-Wrapped-Ether-Token/proofs/ERC20WrappedEth.v) available for the proof of the `burn` verification condition.
